                <h2 className="text-lg md:text-2xl font-medium ">5. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h2>
                <p><span className="text-lg font-bold">In Short:</span> If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media
                    account, we may have access to certain information about you.</p>
                <p>Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social
                    media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do
                    this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media
                    provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media
                    provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and
                    profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a
                    social media platform.
                </p>
                <p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this
                    privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services.
                    Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your
                    personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that
                    you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your
                    personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites
                    and apps.
                </p>
                <h2 className="text-lg md:text-2xl font-medium ">6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
                <p><span className="text-lg font-bold">In Short:</span> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes
                    outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>
                <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the
                    purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or
                    permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose
                    in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the
                    period of time in which users have an account with us.
                    When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
                    information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not
                    possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup
                    archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from
                    any further processing until deletion is possible.
                </p>
                <h2 className="text-lg md:text-2xl font-medium ">7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
                <p><span className="text-lg font-bold">In Short:</span> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
                    organizational and technical security measures.
                </p>
                <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational
                    security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we
                    process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no
                    electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be
                    guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers,
                    cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our
                    security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although
                    we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
                    information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the
                    Services within a secure environment.
                </p>
                <h2 className="text-lg md:text-2xl font-medium ">8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
                <p><span className="text-lg font-bold">In Short:</span> In some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United
                    Kingdom (UK), and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and
                    control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your
                    account at any time.
                </p>
                <p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain rights under
                    applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and
                    obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii)
                    to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data
                    portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the
                    processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting
                    us by using the contact details provided in the section "<span className="text-[#315ED2]">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT

                    protection laws.

                <p>If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing
                    your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your <span className="text-[#315ED2]">Member State
                        data protection authority</span> or <span className="text-[#315ED2]">UK data protection authority.</span>

                <p><span className="text-lg font-bold underline-offset-4">Withdrawing your consent:</span> If we are relying on your consent to process your
                    personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on
                    the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can
                    withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details

                </p>
                <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before
                    its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your
                    personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than
                    consent.</p>
                <p><span className="text-lg font-bold underline-offset-4">Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:</span> You can unsubscribe

                    we may still communicate with you — for example, to send you service-related
                    messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to

                <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications
                    include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your
                    privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored
                    and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
                    implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond
                    to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates
                    your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that
                    we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised
                    version of this privacy notice.</p>
